# RailwayReservation
Basic Java programming based project on Railway Reservation System.
Worked on a mini-project with my peers Aditya and Aryaman using basic Java concepts.
This railway reservation system consists of around 5-6 classes which can book tickets for passengers and display their information. The user needs to fill in the information as we have used scanner class in our project.
